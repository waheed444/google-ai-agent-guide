## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

Provides a **high-level overview** of agentic AI and its impact on modern software engineering.  
Explains why AI agents represent a paradigm shift in automation, and how they help startups automate workflows, improve user experiences, and solve previously infeasible problems.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Core Concepts of AI Agents

### üìå Key Components of Every Agent
Explains the **building blocks** of an agent:
- **Models** ‚Üí The ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the agent, handling reasoning & response generation.
- **Tools** ‚Üí Extend capabilities to call APIs, access data, and perform actions.
- **Data Architecture** ‚Üí Long-term memory, working memory, and transactional state management.
- **Orchestration** ‚Üí Plans multi-step tasks using frameworks like **ReAct (Reason + Act)**.
- **Runtime** ‚Üí Infrastructure for secure, scalable deployment.

### üîó The Role of Grounding in Agentic Systems
Covers **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, **GraphRAG**, and **Agentic RAG** for making agents **trustworthy and fact-based**.  
Explains how to connect agents to real-time data sources, verify facts, and prevent hallucinations.

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways (Core Concepts)
Summarizes **best practices for choosing models, designing tools, and orchestrating workflows** to build intelligent, reliable agents.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Build AI Agents

### üõ† A Complete Toolkit for Building AI Agents
Introduces **Google‚Äôs Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, and **Agent2Agent (A2A)** for collaborative multi-agent systems.

### üìã Step-by-Step: Defining an LLM Agent
Walks through building agents from scratch:
- Select the right agent architecture (LLM Agent, Workflow Agent, or Custom Agent).
- Define tools with clear function signatures and schemas.
- Implement **ReAct loops** for reasoning + acting.
- Test and debug with ADK‚Äôs observability tools.

### üè¢ Govern & Scale with Google Agentspace
Explains how **Google Agentspace** enables:
- No-code agent creation for non-technical teams.
- Orchestrating and managing a workforce of multiple agents.
- Cross-application workflows and data integration.

### üß© Other Options for Building Agents
Explores additional tools and integrations:
- **Gemini Code Assist** for developer productivity.
- **Gemini Cloud Assist** for cloud infrastructure automation.
- Open-source options like LangChain, CrewAI, and LangGraph.

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways (Build)
Best practices for **rapid prototyping**, **evaluation before deployment**, and **choosing scalable runtime environments** like Vertex AI Agent Engine or Cloud Run.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Ensuring Reliable & Responsible AI Agents

### üß™ AgentOps for Production-Readiness
Introduces **AgentOps**, a framework for:
- Continuous evaluation.
- Performance monitoring.
- Debugging reasoning traces and tool usage.

### üîê Responsible & Secure Agent Design
Covers techniques for:
- **Safety filters** (to block harmful content).
- **Access control** (for secure data usage).
- **Compliance** (auditing and observability).

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways (Reliability)
Checklist for launching **safe, production-grade AI agents**.
